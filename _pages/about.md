I am Jovan Stojkovic, a second year PhD student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am part of [i-acoma group](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/) led by professor [Josep Torrellas](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/josep/torrellas.html). My research focus is on cloud computing data platforms and deployment paradigms, such as microservices and serverless computing. I enjoy building systems and exploring ways to make them fast, reliable, and
efficient in a holistic manner: from the hardware architecture up to the platform and application level.
