I am Jovan Stojkovic, a fifth year PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a member of [i-acoma group](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/) led by professor [Josep Torrellas](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/josep/torrellas.html).

My research focus is on the cloud platforms and emerging deployment paradigms, such as microservices and serverless computing. These workloads promise great scalability, simple programming model, and cost-effective billing model. However, their characteristics significantly differ from traditional cloud applications, leading to inefficiencies in current cloud environments. As these paradigms become more important, my goal is to design novel hardware platforms and software stacks that enable their execution with orders of magnitude better performance, energy, and resource efficiency.

My research focuses on **cloud computing and datacenters**, with two primary application domains: (1) *cloud-native* workloads such as microservices and serverless computing, and (2) *machine learning (ML) inference*, particularly large language models (LLMs).

Cloud-native workloads represent a shift in how services are deployed and managed, offering scalability, a simplified programming model, and cost-effective billing. However, these benefits come with new challenges. Unlike traditional monolithic applications, microservices and serverless functions exhibit high communication overhead, fine-grained execution, bursty invocation patterns, and focus on optimizing for tail latency—all of which lead to poor performance, resource, and energy inefficiency on conventional cloud infrastructure. As these deployment paradigms gain traction, my research aims to co-design novel hardware platforms and software systems that deliver orders-of-magnitude improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and resource utilization for these emerging workloads.

In parallel, I focus on the rapidly growing demands of ML inference, especially the inference of generative LLMs. These models now serve latency-sensitive applications under strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs), often relying on power-hungry GPUs to meet performance demands. This has led to a dramatic rise in power draw and energy consumption from inference clusters. My work addresses this challenge through smart scheduling, workload placement, and system-level configuration tuning to reduce energy, power, and thermal overheads—while maintaining performance and accuracy guarantees.
