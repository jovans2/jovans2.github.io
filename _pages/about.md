I am Jovan Stojkovic, a third year PhD student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am part of [i-acoma group](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/) led by professor [Josep Torrellas](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/josep/torrellas.html). 

My research focus is on the cloud computing data platforms and deployment paradigms, such as microservices and serverless computing. I have been working on novel hardware and software abstractions in data-center architectures. I enjoy building systems and exploring ways to make them fast, reliable, and efficient in a holistic manner: from the hardware architecture up to the platform and application level. 


I won the [Kenichi Miura Award (2022)](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/awards/graduate-fellowships-awards/kenichi-miura-award) for excellence in High Performance Computing.
Also, I was awarded student travel grants to attend MICRO'22 and ASPLOS'22 conferences.
I completed my undergraduate studies at [School of Electrical Engineering](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/en), University of Belgrade, Serbia. Every year (2017-2020), I won the award for the best student of Computer Engineering and Information Theory Department.
